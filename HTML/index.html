    <h2>Welcome to Polly's Pickles!</h2>
    <p>
      This local business was founded by Louisville native, Polly Reynolds in 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly hails from a southern heritage where family dinners and recipe sharing is commonplace. In memory of her late grandmother, Nanny, Polly began re-creating the same sweet pickles Nanny had been making for her family year before.
    </p>

    <p>As Polly's family expanded and the demand for these pickles at dinners and holidays grew, she founded Polly's Pickles as a way to share a bit of her southern family tradition with everyone!</p>

    <h2>The Pickles</h2>
    <p>Relish dishes have had a long standing tradition at the Thanksgiving and Christmas table. These platters of pickled goodies were the announcement that a larger, heartier meal was to come and warmed up our taste-buds for the inevitable feast!

    Polly's Pickles are made from Kosher Dill whole pickles, cut thin with her special blend of spices to make them sweet. Pickles are made to order and take about two weeks to prepare. Around the holidays, pickles are made in bulk, so the wait time may be less as that is the most popular time for this celebratory relish! </p>
