# Pollys_Pickles

This is a website for my sister-in-laws new business she is working to get off of the ground. She makes her own sweet pickles and this site is designed to inform customers about the history of the pickles, who she is, and allow them to order various sizes and quantities of her pickles.

The pieces I am still working on are the following:
- getting the javascript to add the total cost of the pickles that are filled out in the order form
- getting a pay service like apple pay to link up to this to actually transfer funds for the order. I have been informed of a few services, but as this is not live yet, I won't be utilizing that yet.

In order to use the site, run index.html. It should pull up the Home page that informs you about the pickles and my sister-in-law. From there, you should be able to navigate to the Order form and the Contact page at the top of the page. 

On the Contact page, you'll be able to click on Polly's email address and an outlook email will pop up with a subject line already created called "Pickle Inquiry".

On the Order Page, you will be able to select the size of pickle jar you want, as well as the quantity, up to 12 units. If you go over 12 units, you will receive an error message telling you not to order over 12.

Breakpoints are the following:
Mobile View
769px- width of text moves to 70% of screen
1024px- text moves left and pictures move right to make it all on one screen with min. scrolling.


This will eventually be hosted on PollysPickles.com.

Thanks!
